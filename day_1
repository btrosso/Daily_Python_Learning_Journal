Today I learned about different data types and some basics surreounding arithmetic and string operations.

#Stuff i dont know or needed brushing up on:

** - power of (another way of doing exponents)
// - divided by and it rounds down; returns an integer instead of float

complex - data type, deals with complex numbers

bin() - function that returns the binary representation of an integer

constants - should be in all caps
#don't create variables that start with double underscores

assigning multiple variables quickly
EX: a,b,c = 1,2,3

Can use three single quotes for long multi-line strings. '''
like this
and this
'''

#Escape Sequence:
\ - whatever comes directly after the backslash is included in the string
\t - add tab spacing
\n - new line
